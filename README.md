# Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies

These are my assignments from Princeton's course
1. **Scrooge Coin** => 95%
2. **Consensus From Trust** => 81%
3. **BlockChain** => 60% (I would appreciate some help on this one)

**PS:** Tests, require you to install JUnit framework
Considerable amount of test code is not my own. I did my best to give credit where it is due, but please reach out if you think I can do a better job. My email: artem_chumak@hotmail.com
